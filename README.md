# Mima
 An emulator of the "minimal machine" ("mima") used as a processor model for learning purposes.
 This project implements a cli compiler for its instructions as well as a virtual runtime to execute and debug mima programs.
 
 The Emulator executable is a cli application, so try it out by just running it.

#Running
 
 - Go ahead and write a Program using the existing mima commands (you can check out 'Mima/example/Example.mima' for reference)
 - Start the Program 'Mima/bin/Mima.exe'
 - Enter the path to your Program and see the emulation run

#Installation
 
 To run it yourself, you need to have C++ installed

 - Then clone this repository (git clone https://github.com/BertilBraun/Mima)

 - Start the Visual Studio Solution and Run

 Otherwise build it with clang or something similar, idk how :)
